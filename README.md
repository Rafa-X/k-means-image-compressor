# k-means Image Compressor
Using the Machine Learning algorithm K-Means, applies clustering to reduce the number of colors in an image, effectively compressing it while preserving visual quality. <br><br>

This project demonstrates the power of clustering algorithms in image processing, optimizing storage while maintaining a visually recognizable output. <br><br>

## How to use
* Select an image from your storage
* Specify a value for K, which is the amount of colours for k-means to reduce the image
* Press ***Compress Image***, the compressed image will display in the right side

## How to use the Graphics
| Graphics              | What does display? |
| --------------------- | ---------- | 
| Show Palette          | Quantity of colours in the original image and compressed image <br> <img width=100% src="images/show_palette.png" align="center"> |
| Show Graphic Color    |
| Show Clusters         |
